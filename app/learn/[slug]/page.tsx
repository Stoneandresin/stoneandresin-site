    title: "Resin‑Bound vs. Epoxy‑Pebble: What Ohio Homeowners Should Know",
    body: `When choosing a decorative stone surface for your driveway or patio, you'll likely encounter two main options: resin-bound and epoxy-pebble systems. Understanding the key differences can help you make the right choice for your Ohio property.

**What is Resin-Bound?**

Resin-bound surfaces mix UV-stable polyurethane resin with natural aggregates, creating a smooth, porous surface. The stones are fully coated in resin before application, resulting in a permeable finish that allows water to drain through.

**What is Epoxy-Pebble?**

Epoxy-pebble (also called resin-bonded) applies a layer of epoxy to a surface, then broadcasts decorative pebbles on top. The stones are bonded to the surface rather than encapsulated in resin.

**Key Differences for Ohio Homeowners:**

*Permeability & Drainage*
Resin-bound systems are naturally porous, reducing puddles and runoff—critical for Ohio's wet springs and heavy rainstorms. Epoxy-pebble is typically non-porous, leading to standing water and potential drainage issues.

*UV Stability*
Resin-bound uses aliphatic resins that resist yellowing and maintain color in direct sunlight. Epoxy-pebble often uses aromatic resins that can amber or discolor over time, especially during hot Ohio summers.

*Durability*
Resin-bound creates a monolithic surface where stones are locked in place. Epoxy-pebble can experience loose stones over time, particularly in high-traffic areas or under freeze-thaw cycles common in Ohio.

*Maintenance*
Resin-bound surfaces are easier to clean—debris can be swept or power-washed without dislodging stones. Epoxy-pebble requires gentler cleaning to avoid removing bonded pebbles.

**Which is Right for You?**

For driveways, patios, walkways, and pool decks in Ohio, resin-bound systems typically offer better long-term performance. The permeability helps with stormwater management, UV stability keeps colors true, and the durable finish withstands our climate's freeze-thaw cycles.

Epoxy-pebble may be suitable for vertical surfaces, decorative accents, or covered areas where drainage and UV exposure aren't concerns.`

    title: "Permeable Driveways & Ohio Drainage: What You Need to Know",
    body: `Ohio's wet springs, summer thunderstorms, and winter freeze-thaw cycles make proper drainage essential for any driveway or patio. Permeable surfaces offer a practical solution that benefits both your property and local water management.

**Why Permeability Matters in Ohio**

Traditional concrete and asphalt driveways create impermeable surfaces that force water to run off into storm drains, yards, or streets. This can lead to:
- Standing water and puddles after rain
- Ice formation in winter
- Erosion around your driveway edges
- Overwhelmed storm sewers during heavy rain
- Potential flooding issues in low-lying areas

**How Permeable Surfaces Work**

Permeable resin-bound driveways allow water to drain directly through the surface into the sub-base below. When properly installed over a porous sub-base, these systems can drain up to 600 liters per square meter per minute—more than enough to handle Ohio's heaviest downpours.

**Ohio Drainage Requirements**

Many Ohio municipalities are implementing stormwater management ordinances that encourage or require permeable surfaces for new construction and major renovations. Check with your local building department about:
- Impervious surface limits for your property
- Stormwater management credits or incentives
- Required drainage plans for new driveways
- Local soil conditions and water table depth

**Site Preparation is Critical**

For permeable driveways to function properly in Ohio's climate:

*Soil Assessment*
Test soil drainage capacity. Clay-heavy Ohio soils may need underdrains or modified sub-base design.

*Sub-Base Design*
Typically requires 4-8 inches of clean, open-graded stone that allows water passage while providing structural support.

*Edge Restraints*
Proper edging prevents sub-base migration and maintains drainage capacity over time.

*Grade & Slope*
Minimum 1-2% slope ensures surface water moves toward drainage points while sub-surface water percolates downward.

**Maintenance for Drainage Performance**

Keep your permeable surface draining properly:
- Remove leaves and debris regularly (especially in fall)
- Power-wash annually to clear any clogged pores
- Avoid sealants that could block permeability
- Address any settling or low spots promptly

**Benefits Beyond Drainage**

Permeable driveways offer additional advantages:
- Reduced ice formation (water drains rather than pooling)
- Less water pooling means longer surface life
- Environmental benefits (natural groundwater recharge)
- Potential for lower stormwater fees in some municipalities

**Is Your Property Suitable?**

Permeable resin-bound systems work well for most Ohio residential properties, but consult with an experienced installer about:
- High water table areas (may need modified drainage)
- Very steep slopes (may need additional engineering)
- Areas with heavy clay soils (may need underdrains)
- Locations near wells or septic systems (code requirements vary)`

  "maintenance": {
    title: "Maintaining Your Resin-Bound Surface: Keep It Looking New",
    body: `A properly installed resin-bound surface requires minimal maintenance, but following these guidelines will keep your driveway, patio, or walkway looking pristine for years.

**Regular Maintenance (Weekly/Monthly)**

*Remove Debris*
Sweep or blow off leaves, dirt, and organic matter regularly. Accumulated debris can stain the surface and clog pores, reducing drainage capacity.

*Rinse as Needed*
Use a garden hose to rinse away dust, pollen, and light dirt. This is especially important during spring pollen season and after leaf fall in autumn.

*Spot Clean Spills*
Address spills promptly:
- Oil/grease: Blot (don't wipe), then use a pH-neutral cleaner
- Food/beverages: Rinse with water immediately
- Pet waste: Remove solid material, rinse thoroughly

**Seasonal Deep Cleaning**

*Spring (April-May)*
- Power-wash the entire surface (1500-2000 PSI maximum)
- Use a wide fan tip, keep 12-18 inches from surface
- Remove winter salt residue and winter debris
- Check for any areas needing repair

*Summer (July-August)*
- Light pressure wash to remove accumulated dust
- Inspect for any weed growth at edges (rare but possible)
- Check that drainage remains effective during heavy rains

*Fall (October-November)*
- Remove leaves promptly—wet leaves can stain
- Pre-winter cleaning to prevent organic buildup
- Clear any clogged areas before winter

*Winter (As Needed)*
- Use plastic shovel for snow removal (avoid metal edges)
- Apply ice melt sparingly—calcium chloride is safer than rock salt
- Avoid excessive salt that can leave white residue

**Stain Removal**

For stubborn stains, use these approaches:

*Oil & Grease Stains*
1. Apply absorbent material (cat litter, sawdust) immediately
2. Let sit for several hours to absorb oil
3. Sweep away absorbent material
4. Use pH-neutral degreaser or dish soap solution
5. Scrub gently with soft brush
6. Rinse thoroughly with water

*Rust Stains*
1. Use a rust remover safe for stone surfaces
2. Follow product instructions carefully
3. Test in inconspicuous area first
4. Rinse thoroughly after treatment

*Organic Stains (Leaves, Berries)*
1. Remove source material immediately
2. Pressure wash affected area
3. For set stains, use mild bleach solution (1:10 bleach:water)
4. Let sit for 10-15 minutes
5. Scrub gently and rinse thoroughly

*Tire Marks*
1. Most fade naturally with weathering
2. For persistent marks, use gentle degreaser
3. Pressure wash with warm water if available

**What to Avoid**

*Never Use:*
- High-pressure washers over 2000 PSI (can damage surface)
- Metal shovels or sharp tools
- Harsh acidic cleaners (can damage resin)
- Sealants or coatings (blocks permeability)
- Wire brushes or abrasive pads

*Avoid:*
- Parking in the exact same spots daily (can cause wear patterns)
- Dragging heavy items across the surface
- Using de-icing products with harsh chemicals
- Allowing gasoline or solvents to sit on surface

**Weed Prevention**

While rare, weeds can occasionally appear at surface edges:
- Pull by hand when small
- Use targeted weed killer at edges only (avoid surface)
- Ensure proper edge restraints are maintained
- Address any sub-base exposure promptly

**Annual Professional Inspection**

Consider having your installer inspect the surface annually to:
- Check for proper drainage function
- Identify any areas needing repair
- Assess overall condition
- Provide specific care recommendations

**Extending Surface Life**

These practices maximize your investment:
- Address small issues promptly before they grow
- Maintain proper drainage to prevent water damage
- Keep surface clean to prevent organic growth
- Avoid heavy vehicle impacts when possible
- Ensure proper edge support remains intact

**When to Call for Repairs**

Contact your installer if you notice:
- Areas where stones are loosening or coming free
- Significant cracks or damage
- Persistent drainage problems
- Large or spreading stains that won't clean
- Settling or uneven areas

**Expected Longevity**

With proper maintenance, a quality resin-bound surface should maintain its appearance and function for 15-25+ years. The key is consistent, gentle care rather than aggressive or infrequent cleaning.`
